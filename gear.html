<h1>It's time to get some gear.</h1>
<em>This is your opportunity to look awesome and really see how much you need for a good time. This section will go over what clothes you need and what equipment you need</em>

<h3>Layers, layers, layers</h3>
<body>The mountain is cold. You'll be constantly spraying up snow into your face, and people will constantly be spraying snow into your face. You need to be prepared to deal with the cold or else you're going to have a really bad time. This means wearing three separate layers.
  <p>The first layer are your thermals. These should be what's actually touching your skin. You'll want thermal tops and bottoms, in some cases even two pairs for each depending on how cold it is. They'll act to conserve warmth and to wick moisture away from your body.You should also be wearing two pairs of socks as a base layer, your feet can get cold easily.</p>
  <p>The second layer are sweaters and sweatpants. These will act as your main form of insulation to keep the heat inside your body. They can also act as padding for a fall. You'l' usually be okay with only one of these for top and bottom. </p>
    <p>The third layer is the layer everyone sees. That is, of course, your jacket, snowpants, mask and gloves. Your jacket and snowpants will keep you dry, all your movement will melt the snow and you'd be soaked without them. Your gloves keep your hands warm and your fingers dry and protect your hands when you put them out to break a fall. Your mask is absolutely necessary if you don't want to be eating snow the whole time. In some cases, like when I went to Stowe last February, the mountain was -40 with windchill at the top and snowing so hard you couldn't see five feet in front of you. The lift operators weren't letting people up without masks. Buy a mask, for your own sake. </p>

    <h3>The fun stuff</h3>
    <body>This is where you get to pick your board, boots and helmet. Yes, you'll be wearing a helmet, literally everyone does. My life has been saved by my helmet more times than I'm willing to admit. Please wear a helmet.
      <p>When it comes to boots and a board, there are a couple things to consider. First of all, they're very expensive. A nice board will run you more than half a thousand dollars, boots are usually a couple hundred. Boots should fit snugly but not too tight that they rub uncomfortably when you move into a carve. Your board, when standing straight up, should come to between your nose and your chin. Riding through powder will require a thicker, longer and stiffer board than grinding rails in the park will. It all depends on what you want to do. For your first couple times, rent a board and boots to see what fits well, and then look into investing into a permanent set. </p>
