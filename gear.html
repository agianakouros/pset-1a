<h3>Layers, layers, layers</h3>

<div>
<p>The mountain is cold. You'll be constantly spraying up snow into your face, and people will constantly be spraying snow into your face. You need to be prepared to deal with the cold or else you're going to have a really bad time. This means wearing three separate layers.</p>
  <p>The first layer are your thermals. These should be what's actually touching your skin. You'll want thermal tops and bottoms, in some cases even two pairs for each depending on how cold it is. They'll act to conserve warmth and to wick moisture away from your body.You should also be wearing two pairs of socks as a base layer, your feet can get cold easily.</p>
  <p>The second layer are sweaters and sweatpants. These will act as your main form of insulation to keep the heat inside your body. They can also act as padding for a fall. You'll usually be alright with just one of these for top and bottom. On extremely cold days or if you're wearing a light outer layer, you could need more. </p>
    <p>The third layer is the layer everyone sees. That is, of course, your jacket, snowpants, mask and gloves. Your jacket and snowpants will keep you dry; all your movement would melt the snow and and soak you without them. Your gloves keep your hands warm, your fingers dry and protect your hands when you put them out in front of you to break a fall. I once went up a mountain on a 50 degree day with a friend who refused to wear gloves because his hands weren't cold. He fell and, as you could expect, suffered a severe loss of skin on his hand that hit the snow first. Your mask is absolutely necessary if you don't want to be eating snow the whole time. In some cases, like when I went to Stowe last February, the mountain was -40 with windchill at the top and snowing so hard you couldn't see five feet in front of you. The lift operators weren't letting people up without masks. Buy a mask for your own sake. An example of a good one would be something like

		<div>
    <p>This is where you get to pick your board, boots and helmet. Yes, you'll be wearing a helmet, literally everyone does. My life has been saved by my helmet more times than I'm willing to admit. Please wear a helmet.<p>
      <p>When it comes to boots and a board, there are a couple things to consider. First of all, they're very expensive. A nice board will run you more than half a thousand dollars, boots are usually a couple hundred. Boots should fit snugly but not too tight that they rub uncomfortably when you move into a carve. Your board, when standing straight up, should come to between your nose and your chin. Riding through powder will require a thicker, longer and stiffer board than grinding rails in the park will. It all depends on what you want to do. For your first couple times, rent a board and boots to see what fits well, and then look into investing into a permanent set. If you think it's time to buy a board, check out popular manufacturers like <a href="https://www.burton.com/us/en/home">Burton</a> for some high quality products good for beginners and experts alike. You can click on the image of the board below, the Burton Flight Attendant, to be taken to its page on the Burton website. That's the board I'm currently using, it's designed specifically for deep powder. This means it has a camber that's shifted back, is longer than a usual board, and has a narrower tail than nose. </p>
      <p>Now, buying a board isn't as simple as deciding you want one. You have to think about what you'll be doing on the mountain. Hitting rails and pipes in the park will require a flexible and short board, while landing big jumps and plowing through four feet of fresh powder will warrant the purchase of a stiffer and longer one. You also have to what type of flex you want, what board compound you want, if you want the camber or rocker to be shifted or not, the list goes on and on. The chart right below shows how Burton rates its boards in terms of softness and skill application.

<div><p>As was stated before, the chart above shows how a board company might rate their decks in multiple categories. Basically, the personality section tells you how soft the board is (how easily it will bend) vs how hard and stiff it is (how well it will hold up in corners). For rails and small jumps, you want a soft board that's easier to move around while for sharp cornering and really long jumps you'll want a board that's harder so it won't flex at all or give out when you're pushing it to the limit. The next part tells you what terrain the board is good for. The park means rails, smaller jumps and pipes, while back country means deep powder, glades and possibly some large jumps. </p><div>
