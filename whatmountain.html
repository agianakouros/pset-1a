<h1> What mountain is the right one for you?</h1>
<body><em> While finding a mountain might sound as simple as just googling it, everyone needs a mountain that suits their needs. In this section, we'll go over how to do that. You might be tempted to ignore this section and go to the nearest mountain to you or your experienced friend's favorite mountian, but unless you want to end up like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y47fxapdgJo">this guy<a/>, then I suggest you read closely. If you've already
decided on a mountain and need some ideas on what gear you'll need, head over to
our <a href="gear.html">suggested gear page.</a></em></body>

  <h2> What you'll need to think about</h2>
  <body> Mountains are all different. Some cater to the more experienced and some
    are easier for newcomers. The most important things to consider when picking a Mountain
    are how many trails of each difficulty there are and how far away the mountain actually is.</body>

    <h3> Trailcount and difficulty</h3>
      <body> No one mountain will suit everybody. While a mountain like <a href="https://www.whistlerblackcomb.com/">Whistler Blackomb</a> won't be kind to beginners, a mountain like <a href="https://www.skicamelback.com"> Camelback in Pennsyvania</a> won't be entertaining for experts. Mountains feature four difficulty levels of trails, along with some others not classified in the same system. The trail difficulties range from (listed in order of easiest to hardest):

        <ol>
          <li>Green Circle</li>
          <li>Blue Square</li>
          <li>Black Diamond</li>
          <li>Double Black Diamond</li>
              </ol>

        Along with these trails, there are what are called glades. Glades are pockets of forest skimmed of rocks and large roots before the season begins. When it snows, the mountain lets people snowboard through them in what is probably the highest-skill-requirement activity available on any normal mountain. These glades range from green, being basically no challenge at all, to double black, which is basically a straight down drop through a natural forest with trees every three feet. If it's your first time on a mountain, you'll want to go to one with more green and blue trails rather than blues and blacks. You'll want to stay completely  away from all the blacks and doubles until you're at an expert level, so choosing a mountain with few of those is a good idea. That way, you don't get bored doing the same green over and over again. </body>

        <h3>How far away is the mountain?</h3>
          <body>This is more of a sefety thing than anything else. Snowboarding, no matter if it's your first or thousandth time, is super tiring. If the person driving to the mountian is also snowboarding, they're going to be really tired on the way back.
            Driving to a mountain five or more hours away for a day trip, snowboarding all day, and then driving back isn't safe. The last thing anyone wants is an asleep-at-wheel situation (which, I can tell you from experience, isn't fun). Choose a Mountain
            moderately far away, still close enough to drive to. You shouldn't be doing more driving in a day than snowboarding. To find out how far away by drive it is, <a href="google.com"> google it</a> and you'll get an estimated number of hours (traffic included).</body>
