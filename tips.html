<div>
	<em>There are lots of rules and courtesies that you need to know before you start your climb up the mountain (or if you're planning on having some prohibited fun and need to know what to avoid getting caught doing).</em>
</div>

<h3>The man-down-the-mountain rule</h3>
  <p>The list of rules to follow on the mountain are numbered below. </p>

<div id="1"><ol><li>Watch out for the downhill skier.</li></ol></div>

  <p>That's it. There will be other people on the mountain doing the same thing as you - trying to get down as fast and as fun as possible. Collisions between these people are bound to happen. That being said, it is always the job of the man higher up on the mountain to watch out for the guy down below. </p>
		<p>In a collision, the downhill skier is never at fault because they can't see what's behind/up above them. So, it's your job to watch out for the people below you and to do everything within your ability to aboid collisions with them. If you do end up knocking into someone, see if they're okay and apologize. If they're not, take off your board, finish the job and hide the body in the snow so you don't end up with a nasty lawsuit on your hands.</p>
