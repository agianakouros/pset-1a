<h1>The Ultimate Sport</h1>
	<body>
<em> For years since its invention, snowboarding has been hailed as one of the greatest
	extreme sports of all time. It's extremely hard to learn and even harder to master,
	but it can lead you to some of the most fun you will ever have in your life. Read more
	on this site about what you'll need to know for your first time. </em>
	<h3>What is Snowboarding?</h3>
	<body>Essentially, snowboarding is the cooler, younger brother of skiing. Like skiing,
		snowboarding involves going to a mountain with the right gear, buying a lift ticket,
		taking the lift to the top of the mountain and finding your way down at a pace
		directly relevant to your skill level. The whole activity is very safe if done correctly
		and at a non-expert level. This site assumes that you've made the correct choice
		and chosen to try snowboarding instead of skiing for your first time up and down a mountain.
